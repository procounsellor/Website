 *
 * ─── Which tiles are live ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Today and every day behind it. Not tomorrow.
 *
 * The strip used to run today → today+6 and lock all six, on the rule that a
 * daily game you can run ahead on is not a daily game. The rule is right about
 * the future and was silently doing something else to the past: a student who
 * missed Tuesday had no route back to it from anywhere in the app. Days behind
 * today now open the same board with the same scoring, marked as a catch-up,
 * and days already played show what was scored on them.
 *
 * Horizontally scrollable, because seven 84px tiles do not fit a phone and
 * squeezing them until they do makes every one of them too small to tap. The
 * strip scrolls itself to today on mount so the past does not hide the present.
