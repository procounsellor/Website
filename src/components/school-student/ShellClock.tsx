/**
 * The date and time, in the shell header.
 *
 * It lives here rather than on the dashboard hero because the hero version was
 * a line of eyebrow text over a photographic sky, and it lost: you had to go
 * looking for it. This sits in the sticky header next to the streak and points,
 * wearing the same chip as they do, so it is on every school page and reads at
 * a glance rather than on inspection.
 *
 * ─── The tick ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It fires on the MINUTE BOUNDARY, not every sixty seconds from whenever the
 * page happened to load. A plain `setInterval(…, 60_000)` started at :47 shows
 * the wrong minute for 47 seconds out of every one, so a clock next to a
 * student's watch is visibly behind it. The first timeout lands on the
 * boundary, then an interval takes over.
 *
 * Seconds are not shown. A per-second re-render of the shell header, forever,
 * to animate a digit nobody is reading is not a trade worth making.
