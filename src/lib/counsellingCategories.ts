/**
 * Data + copy for the category counselling landing pages
 * (`/engineering-counselling`, `/mba-counselling`, ...).
 *
 * These are the site's commercial-intent pages: someone searching "MBA
 * counselling" wants to talk to a counsellor, not read a blog. Each page
 * therefore serves ONE primary search intent and covers its related keywords
 * inside that single page — deliberately not one thin page per keyword, which
 * is what got the site flagged for thin content in the first place.
 *
 * URL choice: top-level `/mba-counselling`, not `/counselling/mba`.
 * `/counselling/:city` already owns that namespace, exact-match keyword URLs
 * are what the category leaders (Shiksha, CollegeDunia) use, and it leaves
 * `/mba-counselling/pune` free for the city expansion once demand is validated.
 *
 * `expertise` is the contract with the counsellor listing: the values must
 * match the counsellor records' `expertise` array exactly, because the "Get
 * counselling" CTA deep-links to /counsellor-listing with that filter applied.
 *
 * Copy in `sections`/`faqs` is the SEO team's final content for all five
 * categories. Keep it specific and honest — no invented fees, cut-offs,
 * rankings or success-rate claims. Inaccurate content is punished harder
 * than thin content.

          "There are plenty of websites where you can search for colleges. So why consider a counselling platform? One reason is that education decisions rarely happen in isolation. You may need to understand a course, compare colleges, check your admission possibilities, follow deadlines and decide how to arrange your choices — all around the same time.",
          "ProCounsel brings several of these pieces together: personalised admission guidance, experienced admission counsellors, college and course exploration, JEE and NEET rank and college predictors, MHT-CET college prediction and option-form support, admission deadlines, college profiles for shortlisting, and ProBuddies connecting students with college seniors.",
          "ProCounsel has guided 10,000+ students, has 15+ years of experience, and is trusted by 50,000+ families. The platform also supports later stages such as internships, placements and further studies — because getting into college is not the only decision students will make.",
          "The point of guidance is not to tell every student to follow the same path. It is to help each student understand their own options more clearly.",

        question: "What is education counselling?",
        answer:
          "Education counselling is guidance that helps students understand and compare education options based on their academic background, interests, goals and practical circumstances. It can include course selection, college selection, admission planning and higher education decisions.",
      },
      {
        question: "When should a student take career counselling?",
        answer:
          "There is no single “right” time. Students may benefit from career counselling after Class 10, after Class 12, during college or when they are considering a change in direction. It can be especially useful when there are several options but no clear preference.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does an admission counsellor do?",
        answer:
          "An admission counsellor helps students understand the admission process, including relevant colleges, courses, eligibility, applications, deadlines, entrance exams and counselling or choice-filling stages.",
      },
      {
        question: "How can a college admissions counselor help me?",
        answer:
          "A college admissions counselor can help you understand and compare college options, identify questions you should ask before applying and make sense of different parts of the admission process. The exact guidance depends on your course, exam, college and admission route.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does career counselling help students after Class 12?",
        answer:
          "It gives students a structured way to think about their interests, strengths, possible careers and education pathways. Instead of choosing a course only because it is popular, students can compare options based on what actually fits them.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can counselling help me choose the right course?",
        answer:
          "Yes, counselling can help you compare courses by looking at your interests, academic background, career goals, skills and future study options. It cannot predict your future, but it can help you make a more informed choice.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can ProCounsel help me shortlist colleges?",
        answer:
          "ProCounsel provides college profiles, college predictors and admission guidance to help students explore and shortlist options. The website also includes tools for JEE, NEET and MHT-CET-related college and rank planning.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is higher education counseling?",
        answer:
          "Higher education counseling refers to guidance around education choices after school or during later stages of study. It can involve selecting undergraduate or postgraduate courses, comparing institutions, planning admissions and understanding future study pathways.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is career counselling only for students who are confused?",
        answer:
          "No. Even students who have a fairly clear goal can use counselling to test their assumptions, understand alternatives and create a more practical education plan.",
      },
      {
        question: "How can I get expert counselling from ProCounsel?",
        answer:
          "You can explore the counselling and admission resources available through the ProCounsel website and choose the type of guidance relevant to your situation.",
