/**
 * Exam-specific counselling landing pages — `/mht-cet-counselling`,
 * `/jee-counselling`, `/cat-counselling`, ...
 *
 * These sit one level below the category pages (`/engineering-counselling`)
 * and serve a narrower, later-stage intent: someone who already has a result
 * in front of them and is asking "what do I do with this rank". A category
 * page answers "should I do engineering"; an exam page answers "how does CAP
 * choice filling work and how should I order my preferences".
 *
 * Why separate pages rather than sections on the category page, which is what
 * `counsellingCategories.ts` argues for: these are not thin keyword splits.
 * Each page below is a full 1,000+ word answer to a distinct process — CAP
 * rounds, JoSAA, COMEDK choice filling and MBA applications genuinely differ —
 * and a student searching "wbjee counselling registration" is not served by a
 * paragraph inside a general engineering page. Thin pages were the original
 * problem; length and specificity are the fix, not fewer URLs.
 *
 * They reuse `CounsellingCategory` wholesale so one page component, one set of
 * schema and one CTA path serve both tiers. `expertise` maps each exam to the
 * counsellor specialisation its CTA should filter by.
 *
 * Editorial rule, same as the category pages: no invented dates, cut-offs,
 * fees, rankings or admission guarantees. Every page tells students to check
 * the current official notification, because that is both true and the only
 * advice that stays correct after this year's cycle.

          "Your allotment is not based only on your MHT CET percentile. Other things can matter too — your category, eligibility, preferences and the seats available when allotment takes place. So do not look at counselling as simply “my percentile is X, so I will definitely get college Y”. It does not work that neatly, and your preference list can make a real difference.",

That is the basic flow of MHT CET engineering admission.",

Or maybe you are sitting with your parents, looking at your score and thinking, “okay… what do I do now?” That confusion is completely normal. CAT is a major milestone, but getting your percentile is not the end of the MBA admission journey.

        question: "What is XAT counselling?",
        answer:
          "It is the guidance students look for after the XAT result — understanding their options, shortlisting MBA colleges that suit their profile, and working out how to apply and compare offers.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a common counselling process for all XAT colleges?",
        answer:
          "No. Institutes accepting XAT can each have their own application, eligibility and selection procedure. Check the current admission information for every college you are interested in.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do after my XAT result?",
        answer:
          "Look at your score alongside your academics, eligibility and career goals, build a balanced shortlist, then check each institute’s requirements and deadlines before applying.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can my XAT score alone guarantee XLRI admission?",
        answer:
          "No. Admission decisions can involve several factors depending on the institute, including academics, work experience where applicable, selection rounds and interview performance.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does an XAT score college predictor work?",
        answer:
          "It generally compares your score against previous-year trends to suggest colleges worth exploring. It is a starting point for research, not a prediction of admission.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is MBA admission through XAT?",
        answer:
          "It is the route from your XAT score to an MBA seat: shortlisting colleges, applying to each one, going through their selection process and completing admission formalities.",
      },
      {
        question: "How should I shortlist MBA colleges after XAT?",
        answer:
          "Consider programme fit, specialisation, eligibility, fees, location, career outcomes and your own goals — not reputation alone. Keep both ambitious and realistic options.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can XAT score counselling help me choose the right MBA college?",
        answer:
          "It can help you compare your realistic options and think through programme, cost and career fit. The final decision, and the responsibility for it, stays with you.",
