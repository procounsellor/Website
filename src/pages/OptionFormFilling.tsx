    q: "What happens after I pay?",

    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: `A full option form built from scratch is ${rupees(OPTION_FORM_PRICE.NEW)}. If you have already filled a form and want an expert to correct and reorder it, a revision is ${rupees(OPTION_FORM_PRICE.REVISED)}. Both are one-time payments.`,

    q: "How do I pay?",
    a: "The amount is taken from your ProCounsel wallet. If your balance is short, add money on the same page with any UPI app, card or netbanking — the amount is then deducted straight away and your registration is confirmed.",
  },
  {
    q: "I have already filled my form. Can you correct it?",
